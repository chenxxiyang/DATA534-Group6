We decided to register an API key from lufthansa today and browse the data. I registered an API, and it needed to use a Client ID and a Client Secret to get a temporary access token. The token request website shows 596 Service Not Found and I did not find the solution in google.

I asked Dr. Narayan for help and sent a message to him on slack. He said he will check whether is the website problem or not, but he has not reply to me. I will try to reach him tomorrow. During today, we chose another website API as an alternative.
